# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to use the splinter, Browser, and BeautifulSoup dependencies to scrape data about Mars from two different NASA websites.   Firstly, we wanted to scrape the titles and preview text from each article on https://redplanetscience.com/.   Then, we scraped data from a table that contained information about NASA's Curiosity rover from https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html.   We concluded our analysis by generating several graphs from the data scraped from the table.
